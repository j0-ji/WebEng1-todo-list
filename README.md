# ToDo-List
This is a small Project written as part of the "Web-Engineering 1"-course. The task was to create a simple todo-list with HTML/CSS/JS. Because we had 2 weeks instead of 1 like for the other tasks I expanded it, so now it's possible to create projects and then create tasks for each project. 

## Functionality
First you'll need to create a project/group and create tasks after choosing it. While creating tasks you need to input a "due date" and the app highlights it yellow when two or less days are left. If the tasks is due today or in the past it's highlighted red.

**NOTE:** while hovering with the cursor above a project or task item, two orange boxes will appear. The right one is for deleting the current project/task (deleting a project will also delete all tasks in it), the left one was intendet for an editing functionality, but I had no time to implement it.
